## 📦 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher**
  ```bash
  java -version
  ```

- **Maven 3.6+ or Gradle 6+**
  ```bash
  mvn -version
  # or
  gradle -version
  ```

- **Git**
  ```bash
  git --version
  ```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/khatrivishal89/Java.git
   cd Java
   ```

2. **Navigate to a specific project** (e.g., Spring Boot Calculator)
   ```bash
   cd spring-boot-calculator
   ```

3. **Build the project**
   
   For Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```
   
   For Gradle:
   ```bash
   gradle build
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   
   For Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
   
   For Gradle:
   ```bash
   gradle bootRun
   ```

5. **Access the application**
   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Maven
mvn test

# Gradle
gradle test
```

## 📚 Projects

### Spring Boot Calculator
A RESTful calculator service built with Spring Boot demonstrating:
- REST API design
- Service layer architecture
- Exception handling
- Input validation
- Unit and integration testing

**Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/calculate/add` - Addition operation
- `POST /api/calculate/subtract` - Subtraction operation
- `POST /api/calculate/multiply` - Multiplication operation
- `POST /api/calculate/divide` - Division operation

## 🎯 Learning Path

### For Beginners
1. Start with basic data structures implementations
2. Practice common algorithm problems
3. Study design patterns with simple examples
4. Build small Spring Boot applications

### For Intermediate
1. Implement complex data structures (Trie, Segment Tree, etc.)
2. Solve medium-level LeetCode style problems
3. Design and implement microservices
4. Practice system design fundamentals

### For Advanced
1. Optimize algorithms for time and space complexity
2. Implement distributed system components
3. Design scalable architectures
4. Practice mock interviews and code reviews
